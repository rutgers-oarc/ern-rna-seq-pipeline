<img src="https://github.com/rutgers-oarc/ern-rna-seq-pipeline/blob/master/flowchart.png" width="450px" height="350px" />

Nextflow pipeline to run a sample RNA sequence pipeline. Software packages are packed in a singularity image. Mapping was done using pseudo alignment appoach combined with sleuth package for differential gene expression analysis.
